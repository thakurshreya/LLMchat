Want to Build Your Own Personalized ChatBot? Using Your Data? 🤖📚

Yes, it’s totally doable—with just a few tools and some simple steps! This project walks you through how to create a custom chatbot using Vertex AI Agent Builder and Dialogflow on Google Cloud Platform. Train it on your own data to deliver tailored, user-friendly responses.

💡 What are Agent Builder and Dialogflow?

Agent Builder is a feature on Google Cloud that simplifies app development using a touch of code and LLM magic. Dialogflow complements it as a platform to design your application’s flow and interactions. Together, they make the process smooth and straightforward.

📍 I created fitnessGroot, an AI-powered chatbot built with Google’s Agent Builder and a powerful LLM like Gemini 1.0 Pro. Hosted on Google Cloud, it delivers fitness guidance—from workouts to meal plans—based on user prompts.
